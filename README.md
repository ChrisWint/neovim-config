# **neovim-config**

Welcome to my repo used for keeping my Neovim configuration files that are important for me whenever I setup a new system that I use neovim regularly on.

| Plugins | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) | Plugin installer |
| [unite.vim](https://github.com/https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) | Used to create interfaces, dependency of vim-fugitive |
| [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) | Lean & mean status/tabline that's light as air |
| [vimfiler](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim) | Powerful file explorer implemented by vimscript |
| [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) | A Git wrapper for vim |
| [vim-sensible|(https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) | Defaults everyone can agree on |

#### How do I use these files?
First, you'll (obviously) need [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), though ordinary [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) may work also (but the following instructions will not work for Vim). You need to clone this repository and move it to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim.

##### On Mac/Linux/BSD:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Tenn1518/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
That's it! Surprised?

##### On Windows
I don't really know a simple way to clone the repo and move it to ~/AppData/Local/nvim since I don't have a Windows system to test that, so just clone this repository and move the folder to ~/AppData/Local/nvim.

##### To-Do
Add more plugins and stuffs

That's pretty much it.
