# **neovim-config**

Welcome to my repo used for keeping my Neovim configuration files that are important for me whenever I setup a new system that I use neovim regularly on.

| Plugins | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pathogen.vim | Plugin installer |
| --- | --- |
| Unite.vim | Used to create interfaces, dependency of vim-fugitive |

#### How do I use these files?
First, you'll (obviously) need [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), though ordinary [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) may work also (but the following instructions will not work for Vim). You need to clone this repository and move it to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim.

##### On Mac/Linux/BSD:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tenn1518/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
That's it! Surprised?

##### On Windows
I don't really know a simple way to clone the repo and move it to ~/AppData/Local/nvim since I don't have a Windows system to test that, so just clone this repository and move the folder to ~/AppData/Local/nvim.

##### To-Do
Add more plugins and stuffs
That's pretty much it.
